                    Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone 
                    into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better 
                    paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?
    
                    Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people 
                    who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked 
                    and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
